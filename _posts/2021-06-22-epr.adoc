John S. Bell in his landmark paper https://cds.cern.ch/record/111654/files/vol1p195-200_001.pdf[On The EPR Paradox] considered the EPR experiment with a modification -
Alice and Bob's detectors are no longer oriented along the same axis. Alice detector is oriented along stem:[\vec{a}] and Bob's detector is oriented along stem:[\vec{b}]. 

**Question: What is the expected value of Alice's spin stem:[\times] Bob's spin?**

Bell solves it in one line. Or rather, he just gives the answer and leaves it to the reader to work it out:

This problem also appears as Problem 4.55 in DJ Griffiths Introduction to Quantum Mechanics 2nd ed.
Working it out is not trivial for me. I actually had to use the `sympy` package in Python to work it out (the hard or poor man's way).
Let's get started. I won't be showing the full code but bits and pieces of it. First, create the vector corresponding to the spin-singlet state i.e., stem:[\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|01\rangle - |10\rangle)]:

[source,python]
----
psi = 1 / sympy.sqrt(2) * Matrix([[0],[1],[-1],[0]])
----

Next, create the stem:[2 \times 2] matrices corresponding to Alice and Bob. The matrices are identical except for the axes they use:

[source,python]
----
a1, a2, a3, b1, b2, b3 = sympy.symbols('a1 a2 a3 b1 b2 b3', real=True)
M_A = a1 * X + a2 * Y + a3 * Z
M_B = b1 * X + b2 * Y + b3 * Z 
----

where `X, Y, Z` are the Pauli matrices. Now notice that `psi` is a stem:[4 \times 1] vector but the matrices above are stem:[2 \times 2]. The stem:[4 \times 4] matrix corresponding to Alice's observable is given by stem:[I \otimes M_A] and conversely the stem:[4 \times 4] matrix corresponding to Bob's observable is given by stem:[M_B \otimes I] where stem:[I] of course is the identity matrix.

We can calculate these matrices using the `TensorProduct` function (it takes arguments in "`opposite`" order):

[source,python]
----
Alice = TensorProduct(M_A, eye(2))
Bob   = TensorProduct(eye(2), M_B)
----

Now we write a function which will simulate Alice making a measurement on her qubit:

[source,python]
----
alice_measurements, alice_probabilities, psis = measure(psi, Alice)
----

Writing the `measure` function is left as exercise and is key to solving the problem.
The `measure` function takes input the wavefunction `psi` and an observable (given by `Alice` in above).
Remember an observable is a Hermitian matrix. The function returns us 3 things:

* an array of possible measurement outcomes. This is computed by computing the _distinct_ eigenvalues of the input observable. In our case we will get only two distinct eigenvalues: stem:[+1] and stem:[-1].
* an array of the respective probabilities of the outcomes.
* an array containing the collapsed wavefunction in each case.

Next, we need to simulate Bob's measurement for each possible outcome of Alice's measurement (so we have a nested loop):

[source,python]
----
for i in range(0, len(alice_measurements)):
    alice_spin = alice_measurements[i]
    alice_prob = alice_probabilities[i]
    psi = psis[i]
    bob_measurements, bob_probabilities, bob_psis = measure(psi, Bob)
    for j in range(0, len(bob_measurements)):
        bob_spin = bob_measurements[j]
        bob_prob = bob_probabilities[j]
        spin_product.append(alice_spin * bob_spin)
        probabilities.append(alice_prob * bob_prob)
----

The final answer i.e., expected value of Alice's spin stem:[\times] Bob's spin is given by:

[source,python]
----
for i in range(0, len(spin_product)):
    expectation += spin_product[i] * probabilities[i]

sympy.pprint(expectation)
----

Running this does not give the simple stem:[- \vec{a} \cdot \vec{b}]. Instead I get a monstrous expression. I tried simplifying it using the `simplify` function but it didn't help.
To check I didn't have a bug in my code, I evaluated the expression (i.e., compute a numerical value) using the `n()` or `N` function in `sympy` and that did give correct result.
So I don't think there was bug in the code; just that `sympy` is not able to simplify the expression.

The hard way does it using basic principles. And the algorithm can be generalized to any case. But its infeasible to do calculations like this by hand.
How did Bell calculate it by hand? There ought to be a shortcut.

== The Smart Way

Now that we have solved the problem the hard way, let's see how to solve it the smart way. It turns out the answer to the problem is given by the expected value of
the observable formed by stem:[M_B \otimes M_A] (or vice-versa). i.e.,

\begin{equation}
\langle \psi | M_B \otimes M_A | \psi \rangle = - \vec{a} \cdot \vec{b}
\end{equation}

where stem:[\psi] once again is given by stem:[\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|01\rangle - |10\rangle)] or stem:[
\begin{pmatrix}
0 \\ \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \\ -\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \\ 0
\end{pmatrix}
]
and that is what Bell is referring to in his paper.

But why is it like that? First, we - or at least I - know that the expected value of an observable stem:[M] (sometimes also referred to as _operator_) is indeed given by
stem:[\langle \psi | M | \psi \rangle]. The proof of this can be found in Nielsen and Chuang, equation 2.113 p. 88.
Now let's look at stem:[M_B \otimes M_A]:

\begin{equation} \label{eq1}
\begin{split}
M_B \otimes M_A & = (b_1 uu^T + b_2 vv^T) \otimes (a_1 qq^T + a_2 rr^T) \\
 & = a_1 b_1 uu^T \otimes qq^T + a_2 b_1 uu^T \otimes rr^T + a_1 b_2 vv^T \otimes qq^T + a_2 b_2 vv^T \otimes rr^T \\
 & = a_1 b_1 (u \otimes q)(u \otimes q)^T + a_2 b_1 (u \otimes r)(u \otimes r)^T + a_1 b_2 (v \otimes q)(v \otimes q)^T + a_2 b_2 (v \otimes r)(v \otimes r)^T
\end{split}
\end{equation}

The math above itself is not obvious. stem:[a_1, a_2] are eigenvalues of stem:[M_A]. Similarly stem:[b_1, b_2] are eigenvalues of stem:[M_B].
stem:[q, r] are eigenvectors of stem:[M_A] and stem:[u, v] are eigenvectors of stem:[M_B].
The first line follows from the property of eigendecomposition of a matrix and is used often in Nielsen and Chuang. See box 2.2 p. 72 for example.
To get the second line, _prove that the tensor product distributes over addition_. Don't take it for granted. See equations 2.43 and 2.44 p. 73 in Nielsen & Chuang.
To get the third line is very difficult for me so I posted it as a question on
https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/4180543/given-vectors-q-r-prove-that-qqt-otimes-rrt-q-otimes-r-q-otimes-r[SE]. It relies on two properties
(don't take them for granted, _prove them_):

\begin{equation} \label{eq2}
\begin{split}
(u \otimes q)^T & = u^T \otimes q^T (\textrm{eq. 2.53 p.74 Nielsen & Chuang}) \\
(u \otimes q)(u^T \otimes q^T) & = uu^T \otimes qq^T  (\textrm{mixed product property})
\end{split}
\end{equation}

Now we have written stem:[M_B \otimes M_A] as an eigendecomposition and can see that its eigenvalues are nothing but the product of the
eigenvalues of Alice and Bob's matrices. And we are done. QED.

All that is left is to compute stem:[\langle \psi | M_B \otimes M_A | \psi \rangle] and that is something that can be done by hand - not easy for me so I am going to use
`sympy` again.

'''

Note that the expected value of the product of spins is different from the probability that the spins are equal. This
probability is used in e.g., https://youtu.be/RxbTEw0Pz08?t=263[this] video (Fast Forward to 4:30 if you like).
Also see section 2.2 on p.21 in https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~vazirani/f19quantum/notes/191.pdf[this] pdf.

[stem]
++++
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
E[s_a \times s_b] & = (s_a \times s_b) \textrm{Prob}(s_a = s_b) + (s_a \times s_b) \textrm{Prob}(s_a \neq s_b) \\
                  & = +1 \cdot \textrm{Prob}(s_a = s_b) - 1 \cdot \textrm{Prob}(s_a \neq s_b) \\
                  & = p - (1 - p) \\
                  & = 2 p - 1
\end{split}
\end{equation}
++++

which gives:

[stem]
++++
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
\textrm{Prob}(s_a = s_b) & = \frac{1 + E[s_a \times s_b]}{2} \\
             & = \frac{1 + \cos \theta}{2} \\
             & = \cos^2 \frac{\theta}{2}
\end{split}
\end{equation}
++++

which is the formula in that video - or is it? The formula in the video is stem:[\cos^2 \theta].
Another problem is that stem:[E[s_a \times s_b\]] is equal to stem:[-\cos \theta] (refer Bell equation again if you like) and not stem:[+ \cos \theta].
What gives? The stem:[\Psi] we have used is different from the stem:[\Psi] used in the video. In the video he is using:

[stem]
++++
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
\Psi & = \frac{1}{\sqrt 2}|00\rangle + \frac{1}{\sqrt 2}|11\rangle \\
     & = \left[\begin{matrix}\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}\\0\\0\\\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}\end{matrix}\right]
\end{split}
\end{equation}
++++

and if we do that:

----
t = psi.H * TensorProduct(M_A, M_B) * psi
----

gives:

----
>>> t.simplify()
>>> t
[a₁⋅b₁ - a₂⋅b₂ + a₃⋅b₃]
----

This formula is also worked out in https://www.physicsforums.com/insights/bell-states-and-conservation-of-spin-angular-momentum/[this] article.
But this also is not stem:[+ \cos \theta]. What gives now? Well the answer is this: consider what happens to the state
stem:[\frac{1}{\sqrt 2}|00\rangle + \frac{1}{\sqrt 2}|11\rangle] when it is subjected to an arbitrary Unitary transform with bases
stem:[u] and stem:[u^ \perp]. Thus, let:

[stem]
++++
\begin{align}
|0\rangle & = \alpha|u\rangle + \beta|u^\perp\rangle \\
|1\rangle & = \gamma|u\rangle + \delta|u^\perp\rangle \\
\end{align}
++++

giving:

[stem]
++++
\begin{align}
|00\rangle & = (\alpha|u\rangle + \beta|u^\perp\rangle) (\alpha|u\rangle + \beta|u^\perp\rangle) \\
           & = \alpha^2 |uu\rangle + \alpha\beta |uu^\perp\rangle + \beta\alpha|u^\perp u\rangle + \beta^2|u^\perp u^\perp\rangle
\end{align}
++++

Here stem:[\alpha^2] is stem:[\alpha^2]. It is not stem:[|\alpha|^2]. For stem:[|11\rangle] we get:

[stem]
++++
\begin{equation}
|11\rangle = \gamma^2 |uu\rangle + \gamma\delta |uu^\perp\rangle + \delta\gamma|u^\perp u\rangle + \delta^2|u^\perp u^\perp\rangle
\end{equation}
++++

and so in the new basis:

[stem]
++++
\begin{split}
|\Phi^+\rangle & =  (\alpha^2 + \gamma^2) |uu\rangle \\
               & + (\beta^2 + \delta^2) |u^\perp u^\perp\rangle \\
               & + (\alpha\beta + \gamma\delta) (|u u^\perp \rangle +  |u^\perp u \rangle )
\end{split}
++++

and _this is equal to stem:[|uu\rangle + |u^\perp u^\perp \rangle] (an assumption Vazirani is making in his video if you analyze his logic carefully) only if_:

[stem]
++++
\begin{equation}
\begin{pmatrix}
\alpha && \beta \\
\gamma && \delta
\end{pmatrix} 
=
\begin{pmatrix}
\cos \theta && -\sin \theta \\
\sin \theta && \cos \theta
\end{pmatrix} 
\end{equation}
++++

thus the tranform cannot be arbitrary. It has to be a rotation. In other words, stem:[|\Phi^+\rangle] is invariant
to a rotation but not otherwise. This is actually called out in https://www.physicsforums.com/insights/bell-states-and-conservation-of-spin-angular-momentum/[this] article
as well. At the very top of his slide Vazirani does say in bold Rotational Invariance of the Bell State. So he is not considering any arbitrary transform.
He is only considering rotational transforms and the axes stem:[u, u^\perp, v, v^\perp] lie in the stem:[xz] plane i.e., the stem:[y] component is zero.
When that is the case, then a₁⋅b₁ - a₂⋅b₂ + a₃⋅b₃ reduces to a₁⋅b₁ + a₃⋅b₃ and is equal to stem:[\cos \theta]. There is still a problem.
There is a fctor of stem:[2] mismatch. The formula in his video is stem:[\cos^2 \theta] but we get stem:[\cos^2 \frac{\theta}{2}]. What gives? I don't know.

Of the 4 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bell_state[bell states], the spin-singlet state also denoted as stem:[\Psi^-] is the only state that is invariant to any unitary transform.
All other states are invariant only to rotations. Again, read https://www.physicsforums.com/insights/bell-states-and-conservation-of-spin-angular-momentum/[this] article which
explains it.
