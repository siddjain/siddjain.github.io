== Preliminaries 

=== The Probability Amplitude Vector or the Wave Function

A big hurdle in understanding quantum computing is the obnoxious notation that really gets in the way esp. when writing equations on paper.
Anyway begin by recalling that given a system of _n_ qubits, the state of the system is represented by a _probability amplitude vector_
aka _the wave function_ stem:[\Psi] of length **2^n^**. _It is nothing but the joint probability distribution of the 2^n^ states that the qubit register can end up in when measured_.
When the qubit register is _measured_ all the qubits will collapse into `0` s and `1` s giving
a binary number between 0 and 2^n^-1.
_Different measurements will yield different values according to the probability amplitude vector_. 
E.g., with _n=3_, in a random measurement we will get `010` (or the number `2` expressed in decimal).
The _i-th_ component of the _probability amplitude vector_ (e.g., _i=2_ taking example above)
stem:[\Psi] is a complex number, the modulus-square of which will give the probability that when the qubit register is _measured_ it will end up in
the _i-th_ _computational basis state_ (i.e., will have the numerical value _i_). 

Example: consider _n = 3_ qubits. There are 2^3^=8 pure states which can be ordered like so:

----
[000, 001, 010, 011, 100, 101, 110, 111]
----

We can call these as states 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8. i.e., _i = {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8}_.

The _probability amplitude vector_ is a vector of complex numbers of length 2^3^=8 _such that_ following equation holds at all times:

[latexmath#law-of-prob]
.Law of probability
++++
\begin{equation}
\sum_{i=0}^{i=2^n} || \Psi_i || ^ 2 = 1
\end{equation}
++++

which is saying the sum of probabilities should equal 1. The LHS is also known variously as the:

* the _L^2^_ norm of the vector
* the squared length of the vector
* inner product of the vector with itself

=== Quantum Circuits as Unitary Matrix Computations

A quantum circuit can be expressed as a series of matrix transforms i.e., a series of matrix multiplications.
Each matrix transform is such that the transformed _probability amplitude vector_ should obey the law of probability (<<law-of-prob>>)
or equivalently _the length of the input vector should remain the same after the transformation by the matrix_.
Mathematically this means that each matrix has to be _unitary_. The definition of a _unitary_ matrix is that its _adjoint_ is
equal to its inverse. The _adjoint_ of a matrix is defined as its _complex-conjugate transpose_ i.e., first we 
compute the complex-conjugate of the entries and then take the transpose (or vice-versa, we get the same result and order does not matter here).

Given a unitary matrix stem:[U] the _ij-th_ entry in this matrix is nothing but the complex probability amplitude that if the qubits start in
the _j-th_ state, they will end up in _i-th_ state after _measurement_. The complex probability amplitude has to be mod-squared to get the
actual probability.

=== Definition: Superposition

When the _probability amplitude vector_ stem:[\Psi] is such that all entries are `0` except for one which is `1`, it is in a 
_pure state_ or a _computational basis state_. This is the case after _measurement_ when all qubits collapse into definite `0` s or `1` s.
In any other case the _probability amplitude vector_ is in a state of _superposition_. i.e., _superposition_ is defined to be the state when 
stem:[\Psi] is not a "`Kronecker delta`" vector.

=== Definition: Entanglement

All statements below are equivalent and correspond to the case when the qubits are _not_ in entanglement:

* The joint probability distribution function (pdf) of the _n_ qubits can be expressed as a product of individual pdfs 
* The state of the _i-th_ qubit does not depend on the state of the other qubits
* The _probability amplitude vector_ stem:[\Psi] can be factored out into a tensor product of _n_ sub-vectors as below:

[latexmath#factorizable-pdf]
.Un-entangled qubits or factorizable probability amplitude vector
++++
\begin{equation}
\Psi = \otimes_{i=0}^{i=n} \psi_i 
\end{equation}
++++

_Note carefully that in above equation, the LHS is a vector of length 2^n^ whereas the RHS is a tensor product of n vectors, each vector being of length 2._ 

When <<factorizable-pdf>> does not hold i.e., the joint pdf is not factorizable the qubits are in a state of _entanglement_.

=== The Ugly notation

Remember that |0> is shorthand for stem:[\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix}] which is the _probability amplitude vector_ of a single qubit
that is in a definite state. And |1> is shorthand for stem:[\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}].

The pure states of a two qubit system are expressed variously as 

[options=header]
|===
| Notation 1 | Notation 2 | Tensor Product | Probability Amplitude Vector
| \|00> | \|0>\|0> | \|0> stem:[\otimes] \|0> | stem:[\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ 0 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix}]
| \|01> | \|0>\|1> | \|0> stem:[\otimes] \|1> | stem:[\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 1 \\ 0 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix}]
| \|10> | \|1>\|0> | \|1> stem:[\otimes] \|0> | stem:[\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 0 \\ 1 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix}]
| \|11> | \|1>\|1> | \|1> stem:[\otimes] \|1> | stem:[\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 0 \\ 0 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}]
|===

The _probability amplitude vector_ is rarely written down due to its length. It explodes with _n_. But you should always remember that when
you see |00> it is a shorthand for the actual vector.

=== EPR or Bell Pair

The simplest demonstration of entanglement is with the EPR or Bell Pair which is a two qubit system whose wave function is given by
following where the stem:[\frac{1}{\sqrt 2}] scale factor is removed for brevity:

[latexmath]
++++
\Psi = |00> + |11>
++++

[latexmath]
++++
     = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ 0 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix} + \begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 0 \\ 0 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ 0 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}
++++

Verify that this 4x1 vector cannot be expressed as a tensor product of two 2x1 vectors which is the definition of entanglement. Physically,
if the first qubit is `1` it precludes any possibility that the second qubit can be `0`. Thus, the state of the second qubit is not _independent_
of the state of the first qubit (and vice-versa).

== The Deutsch-Josza Algorithm

Considered the Hello World of quantum computing, I found this a very difficult algorithm to understand.
In fact I don't understand it and the reason for making these notes. Here is the circuit diagram.

image::https://i.stack.imgur.com/SottO.png[link="https://quantumcomputing.stackexchange.com/questions/15253/why-isnt-output-of-deutsch-jozsa-algorithm-simply-0"]

In what follows we consider just 2 qubits or the case when _n=1_ in the diagram above.
Understanding the notation used in this and other diagrams like this that appear commonly in books etc.
|stem:[\Psi_0]>, |stem:[\Psi_1]>, |stem:[\Psi_2]> and |stem:[\Psi_3]> are used to mean the total
_probability amplitude vector_ at the four stages in the circuit. |stem:[\Psi_0]> is easy:

[latexmath]
++++
\begin{equation}
\Psi_0 = |0>|1> = |01> = \begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 1 \\ 0 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix}
\end{equation}
++++

To get |stem:[\Psi_1]>, we can try to figure out the 4x4 unitary matrix which will transform |stem:[\Psi_0]> to |stem:[\Psi_1]>.
I have not seen this in any of the books. Rather what they do is to tell the reader to apply the Hadamard transform
individually to the two qubits. Applying Hadamard transform to the |0> qubit gives (|0> {plus} |1>) (I ignore the scale factor for brevity)
and applying it to |1> qubit gives (|0> - |1>). |stem:[\Psi_1]> is then given by the tensor product of these two:

[latexmath#psi1]
++++
\begin{equation}
\Psi_1 = (|0> + |1>) \otimes (|0> - |1>) = |00> - |01> + |10> - |11> 
\end{equation}
++++

[latexmath]
++++
\begin{equation}
  = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ 0 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix} - \begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 1 \\ 0 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix} + \begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 0 \\ 1 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix} - \begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 0 \\ 0 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}
\end{equation}
++++

[latexmath]
++++
\begin{equation}
  = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ -1 \\ 1 \\ -1 \end{pmatrix} 
\end{equation}
++++

The second and third equations are never written in any textbook but that is what stem:[\Psi_1] is. It is an equal superposition of all the pure states.

Getting to stem:[\Psi_2] is going to take a lot of work. First, we need to explain what _f_ is. _f_ is a classical scalar - actually boolean - function.
Its input _domain_ is a _classical_ bit string i.e., a number between 0 and 2^n^-1. For the case when _n=1_, its input can be `0` or `1`. For the case when
_n=2_, its input can be `00`, `01`, `10`, `11` or 0, 1, 2, 3 respectively. And its output is a `0` or `1`. This is one of the things I find hard to
understand in this algorithm. _f_ is a classical function but _x_ is not a classical bit. It is a qubit. What is stem:[f(x)] when stem:[x] is in a superposition
of states - it is not even defined. Anyway what the books tell us to do is this - the effect of the stem:[U_f] circuit is to take |stem:[x,y]> and return
|stem:[x,y \oplus f(x)]> and we apply this rule to <<psi1>> to give:

[latexmath]
++++
\begin{equation}
\Psi_2  = |0,0 \oplus f(0)>  - |0, 1 \oplus f(0)> + |1, 0 \oplus f(1)> - |1, 1 \oplus f(1)> 
\end{equation}
++++

Since stem:[1 \oplus a = \bar a], we get:

[latexmath]
++++
\begin{equation}
\Psi_2  = |0, f(0)>  - |0, \bar f(0)> + |1, f(1)> - |1, \bar f(1)> 
\end{equation}
++++

This gives following 4 possibilities for stem:[\Psi_2]:

[options=header]
|===
| f(0) | f(1) | stem:[\Psi_2]
| 0 | 0 | stem:[\|00>  - \|01> + \|10> - \|11> = A] 
| 0 | 1 | stem:[\|00>  - \|01> + \|11> - \|10> = B] 
| 1 | 0 | stem:[\|01>  - \|00> + \|10> - \|11> = -B] 
| 1 | 1 | stem:[\|01>  - \|00> + \|11> - \|10> = A] 
|===

So when _f_ is a constant i.e., stem:[f(0) = f(1)], we have stem:[\Psi_2 = \pm A] (the positive sign is taken when stem:[f(0) = f(1) = 0] and negative sign otherwise)
and when _f_ is balanced i.e., stem:[f(0) \neq f(1)], we have stem:[\Psi_2 = \pm B].

Now to get stem:[\Psi_3] it is convenient to express stem:[\Psi_2] as following tensor product of two qubits so that we can just apply the Hadamard to first qubit to get stem:[\Psi_3]:

[latexmath#A]
++++
\begin{equation}
A = (|0> + |1>) \otimes (|0> - |1>) = \Psi_1
\end{equation}
++++

[latexmath#B]
++++
\begin{equation}
B = (|0> - |1>) \otimes (|0> - |1>)
\end{equation}
++++

Now since the Hadmard stem:[H] is its own inverse, applying stem:[H] to (|0> + |1>) gives back |0> and applying it to (|0> - |1>) gives back |1>.
And so stem:[\Psi_3] equals:

[latexmath]
++++
\begin{equation}
\Psi_3 = |0> \otimes (|0> - |1>)
\end{equation}
++++

if stem:[f] is constant and

[latexmath]
++++
\begin{equation}
\Psi_3 = |1> \otimes (|0> - |1>)
\end{equation}
++++

if stem:[f] is balanced. The first qubit is in a _definite_ state of either `0` or `1` with 100% probability.
And measuring the first qubit will tell if stem:[f] is constant or balanced which is the problem the Deutsch-Josza Algorithm is supposed to solve.

I find this algorithm extremely confusing and outright "`wrong`" because by definition the stem:[U_f] gate is supposed to leave the first qubit
unchanged - it maps |stem:[x,y]> to |stem:[x,y \oplus f(x)]> whereas <<A>> and <<B>> show just the opposite. _The first qubit gets messed up
whereas the second one is unchanged!_ This is my longstanding dilemma with this algorithm. It is contradictory.
Also see https://quantumcomputing.stackexchange.com/questions/15253/why-isnt-output-of-deutsch-jozsa-algorithm-simply-0[this] question on StackExchange.

Let's also see how to get stem:[\Psi_3] using the long method. We apply Hadamard to the first qubit of stem:[A] and stem:[B] expressions.
This gives us following for the case when stem:[\Psi_2 = A]. I am going to drop off all the ugly brakets to simplify notation:

[latexmath]
++++
\Psi_3 = (0 + 1) 0 - (0 + 1) 1 + (0 - 1) 0 - ( 0 - 1) 1
++++

[latexmath]
++++
       = 00 + 10 - 01 - 11 + 00 - 10 - 01 + 11
++++

[latexmath]
++++
       = 00 - 01 (\textrm{scale factor is not important})
++++

[latexmath]
++++
       = |0> \otimes (|0> - |1>) (\textrm{adding back the brakets})
++++

which agrees with previous result. Let's also do the exercise for when stem:[\Psi_2 = B]:

[latexmath]
++++
\Psi_3 = (0 + 1) 0 - (0 + 1) 1 + (0 - 1) 1 - ( 0 - 1) 0
++++

[latexmath]
++++
       = 00 + 10 - 01 - 11 + 01 - 11 - 00 + 10
++++

[latexmath]
++++
       = 10 - 11 (\textrm{scale factor is not important})
++++

[latexmath]
++++
       = |1> \otimes (|0> - |1>) (\textrm{adding back the brakets})
++++

which again agrees with what we obtained previously using the shortcut method. So at least this much is good.

== Quantum Teleportation

The quantum teleportation circuit is shown in:

image::https://miro.medium.com/max/2000/0*97mRZq_jBC8mSOxk.png[link:https://miro.medium.com/max/2000/0*97mRZq_jBC8mSOxk.png]

stem:[\beta_{00}] is the Bell pair |00> + |11>. Let's do the math dropping the ugly brakets:

[latexmath]
++++
\Psi_0 = \psi \left( 00 + 11 \right) 
++++

To get stem:[\Psi_1] we have to apply a controlled NOT to the second qubit. So we get following two cases:

[options=header]
|===
| stem:[\psi] | stem:[\Psi_1]
| 0 | 000 + 011
| 1 | 110 + 101
|===

Above is when stem:[\psi] is in a pure state either `0` or `1`. In practice it will be in a quantum state:

[latexmath]
++++
\begin{equation}
\psi = \alpha |0> + \beta |1> 
\end{equation}
++++

or simply 

[latexmath]
++++
\begin{equation}
\psi = \begin{pmatrix} \alpha \\ \beta \end{pmatrix}
\end{equation}
++++

This means that stem:[\Psi_1] is given by:

[latexmath]
++++
\begin{equation}
\Psi_1 = \alpha (000 + 011) + \beta (110 + 101)
\end{equation}
++++

where I have dropped the ugly brakets for clarity.
Now we have to apply Hadamard to the first qubit giving:

[latexmath]
++++
\begin{equation}
\Psi_2 = \alpha \left( (0 + 1) 00 + (0 + 1) 11 \right) + \beta \left( (0 - 1) 10 + (0 - 1) 01 \right)
\end{equation}
++++

[latexmath]
++++
\begin{equation}
      = \alpha \left( 000 + 100 + 011 + 111 \right) + \beta \left( 010 - 110 + 001 - 101 \right)
\end{equation}
++++

[latexmath]
++++
\begin{equation}
      = \begin{pmatrix} \alpha \\ \beta \\ \beta \\ \alpha \\ \alpha \\ -\beta \\ -\beta \\ \alpha \end{pmatrix} (\textrm{do it as exercise})
\end{equation}
++++

Now we measure the first two qubits. When we do this those qubits will collapse into definite `0` or `1` and we will be left with the wave function
stem:[\psi_3] of just a single qubit. Suppose we find the first two qubits collpase to `00` upon measuring. Then stem:[\Psi_2] collapses to:

[latexmath]
++++
\begin{equation}
      = \alpha 000 + \beta 001 
\end{equation}
++++

and so stem:[\psi_3] is nothing but stem:[\alpha |0> + \beta |1>] or just stem:[\begin{pmatrix} \alpha \\ \beta \end{pmatrix}]. Similarly,
when we do the exercise for the other cases, we end up with following table of results:

[options=header]
|===
| stem:[M_1] | stem:[M_2] | stem:[\psi_3]
| 0 | 0 | \begin{pmatrix} \alpha \\ \beta \end{pmatrix}
| 0 | 1 | \begin{pmatrix} \beta \\ \alpha \end{pmatrix}
| 1 | 0 | \begin{pmatrix} \alpha \\ -\beta \end{pmatrix}
| 1 | 1 | \begin{pmatrix} -\beta \\ \alpha \end{pmatrix}
|===

Voila! In first case, the state stem:[\psi] has been transmitted as-is. And in all the other cases, we can get back stem:[\begin{pmatrix} \alpha \\ \beta \end{pmatrix}]
by applying simple matrix transformations afforded by the stem:[X] and stem:[Z] gates. The stem:[X] gate interchanges (swaps) the amplitudes while the stem:[Z] gate 
negates the second amplitude. The astute reader will notice that applying stem:[XZ] to 
stem:[\begin{pmatrix} -\beta \\ \alpha \end{pmatrix}] gives
stem:[\begin{pmatrix} -\alpha \\ -\beta \end{pmatrix}] which is stem:[-\psi] not stem:[\psi] but this is
inconsequential as quantum states are indistinguishable 
modulo a global phase factor i.e., the state stem:[\psi] cannot be distinguished from stem:[e^{i\theta}\psi].
If you want to get stem:[\psi] you will apply stem:[X] followed by stem:[Z]. 
But the order of the gates doesn't matter. This is _quantum teleportation_. QED.
