Measuring a single qubit shown diagramatically as

involves measuring the observable stem:[Z]

\begin{equation}
Z = \begin{pmatrix} 1 && 0 \\ 0 && -1 \end{pmatrix}

So you might think - esp. based on diagrams like below:

.From https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_logic_gate[Wikipedia]

that measuring a two qubit system:

involves measuring the observable stem:[Z \otimes Z]. Let's look at the matrix stem:[Z \otimes Z]:

----
⎡1  0   0   0⎤
⎢            ⎥
⎢0  -1  0   0⎥
⎢            ⎥
⎢0  0   -1  0⎥
⎢            ⎥
⎣0  0   0   1⎦

Verify, there are only two eigenvalues of this matrix stem:[+1] and stem:[-1].
So if you measure this observable you are only going to get 2 possible values or answers.
But a two qubit system can be in one of stem:[4] states when its measured (`00`, `01`, `10` or `11`).

_So what gives?_ Well the answer is that _stem:[Z \otimes Z] is not the observable corresponding to measurement of a two qubit system!_

The _correct_ observable (assuming measurement in the "`computational basis`") is given by a stem:[4 \times 4] diagonal matrix with distinct (i.e., no repeated) and non-zero real 
numbers on the diagonal. E.g., one such matrix is:

----
⎡-2  0   0  0⎤
⎢            ⎥
⎢0   -1  0  0⎥
⎢            ⎥
⎢0   0   1  0⎥
⎢            ⎥
⎣0   0   0  2⎦
----

It has 4 eigenvalues stem:[{-2,-1,+1,+2}] corresponding to the 4 states the system can be in when its measured.

We can summarize the learning in following figure:

In Quantum Computing, there is a _big difference between gates and measurements._ 
_Gates are characterized by unitary matrices stem:[UU^\dagger=I] and represent the time evolution of a quantum system._
_Measurements are characterized by Hermitian matrices stem:[M=M^\dagger] and collapse the wavefunction to one of the eigenvectors (also known as eigenstates) of the observable
(also called as operator). The rule for doing time evolution (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schr%C3%B6dinger_equation[Schrodinger's equation]; it becomes a simple gate or matrix in 
Quantum Computing) is different from the rule for doing measurement (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Born_rule[Born's rule]) and that is what all the hungama (drama for English readers) 
is about. This is what Lee Smolin is referring to in his talk:_

Nobody said it better.

At 32:46 he says: _"If we weren't around, only Rule 1 would apply"_. That is what Einstein had in mind when he said: 

> Tell me, do you really think the moon is not there when you don't look at it?

Anyway, let's come back and consider a follow up question: stem:[Z \otimes Z] is a Hermitian matrix as you can verify (stem:[M=M^\dagger]). So it corresponds to an _observable_, but
what? _Answer: it corresponds to measuring value of first qubit (stem:[+1] or stem:[-1]) stem:[\times] value of second qubit._ That is the measurement you will get if you measure
with stem:[Z \otimes Z]. For a system of stem:[n] qubits measuring stem:[Z^{\otimes n}] would give stem:[\Pi_i b_i] where stem:[b_i] is value of the stem:[i]_-th_ qubit (stem:[+1]
 or stem:[-1]).
