What is the difference between SR (special relativity) and GR (general relativity)?

SR is the theory of relativity in the absence of gravity. This can be stated equivalently as saying that SR is the theory of relativity in flat spacetime.
GR is really the theory of gravity. It is the theory of relativity in curved spacetime.

To understand SR, you can start with the postulate that the speed of light has to be constant for all observers (inertial reference frames).
This can be stated equivalently, as saying that the length of spacetime displacement vector (the vector representing motion of light from one point to another)
is invariant between two inertial reference frames under the _Minkowski_ metric. i.e.:

[latexmath]
++++
\begin{equation}
ds^2 = (c dt)^2 - (dx)^2 - (dy)^2 - (dz)^2 = (c dt')^2 - (dx')^2 - (dy')^2 - (dz')^2 
\end{equation}
++++

The prime symbol ' is used to denote a co-ordinate in frame 2.
The Lorentz transformation can then be derived from this assumption. See https://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/821317/question-on-special-relativity[[1]] for some discussion on this whether its right.
In essence, above constraint translates to following _equivalent_ constraint on the Lorentz transformation matrix latexmath:[$\Lambda$]:

[latexmath]
++++
\begin{equation}
\eta^T = \Lambda^T \eta^T \Lambda
\end{equation}
++++

where latexmath:[$\eta$] is the Minknowski metric (or matix depending on how you want to look at it):

[latexmath]
++++
\begin{equation}
\eta = \begin{pmatrix} 1 && 0 && 0 && 0 \\ 0 && -1 && 0 && 0 \\ 0 && 0 && -1 && 0 \\ 0 && 0 && 0 && -1 \end{pmatrix} 
\end{equation}
++++

Remember 1 and 2 are equivalent. You can start from 1 and derive 2 or go in the reverse direction if you so desire.

As I was reading Weinberg p. 35 I was very confused. He says:

[quote,S. Weinberg,Gravitation and Cosmology p. 35]
for any quantity that undergoes the transformation latexmath:[$ \mathbf{V'} = \mathbf{\Lambda V}$], such a latexmath:[$ \mathbf{V}$] should be called a contravariant 4 vector to distinguish it from a covariant 4 vector defined as a quantity latexmath:[$ \mathbf{U}$] whose transformation rule is latexmath:[$ \mathbf{U'} = \mathbf{\Lambda^{-T} U}$]

_How can he decide at whim that some vectors he will transform as latexmath:[$ \mathbf{\Lambda V}$] and that others he will transform as latexmath:[$ \mathbf{U'} = \mathbf{\Lambda^{-T}U}$] ?_

This bothered me to no end and kept me up for many days until I realized that _the Lorentz transformation matrix latexmath:[$ \mathbf{\Lambda}$] tells how co-ordinates transform from one inertial reference frame to another. This is not to be confused with how a quantity such as a 4 vector transforms between the two reference frames._ To his credit, the complete text from Weinberg's book is:

[quote,S. Weinberg,Gravitation and Cosmology p. 35]
for any quantity that undergoes the transformation latexmath:[$ \mathbf{V'} = \mathbf{\Lambda V}$] when the co-ordinate system is transformed by latexmath:[$ \mathbf{x'} = \mathbf{\Lambda x}$] ...

More generally a contravariant vector is a quantity where the i-th component in the other reference frame is given by:

[latexmath]
++++
\begin{equation}
\mathbf{V'_i} = \sum_j \frac{\partial x'_i}{\partial x_j} \mathbf{V_j}
\end{equation}
++++

Here latexmath:[\frac{\partial x'_i}{\partial x_j}] is partial derivative of the i-th co-ordinate in frame 2 w.r.t. j-th co-ordinate in frame 1 evaluated at some point.
Remember these co-ordinates are like functions or variables of multivariate calculus. This can be expressed in matrix form using the Jacobian matrix as:

[latexmath]
++++
\mathbf{V'} = \mathbf{J V}
++++

Recall the Jacobian matrix is the matrix of first-order partial differentials.
When the transformation between the co-ordinates is linear i.e., latexmath:[\mathbf{x' = M x}], then the Jacobian is same as latexmath:[\mathbf{M}].
This is generalization of the fact that when latexmath:[y = k x], latexmath:[dy / dx = k]. In our case, latexmath:[\mathbf{M = \Lambda}].

Note very very carefully that when you are dealing with multi-variate calculus:

[latexmath]
++++
\frac{\partial x_i}{\partial x'_j} \neq \frac{1}{\partial x'_j / \partial x_i}
++++

This is a statement of the fact that given a matrix latexmath:[\mathbf{M}] (in our case replace latexmath:[\mathbf{M}] with the Jacobian latexmath:[\mathbf{J}]):

[latexmath]
++++
\begin{equation}
M = \begin{pmatrix} m_{00} && m_{01} \\ m_{10} && m_{11} \end{pmatrix}
\end{equation}
++++

[latexmath]
++++
\begin{equation}
M^{-1} \neq \begin{pmatrix} \frac{1}{m_{00}} && \frac{1}{m_{01}} \\ \frac{1}{m_{10}} && \frac{1}{m_{11}} \end{pmatrix}
\end{equation}
++++

To get the partial derivatives in the other direction, we have to invert the Jacobian using laws of matrix inversion. i.e., Given:

[latexmath]
++++
\begin{equation}
J_{ij} = \frac{\partial x'_{i}}{\partial x_{j}}
\end{equation}
++++

latexmath:[\frac{\partial x_{i}}{\partial x'_{j}}]
is given by latexmath:[J^{-1}]. e.g., consider the cartesion co-ordinates vs. spherical co-ordinates. Given:

[latexmath]
++++
\begin{equation}
J = \begin{pmatrix} \frac{\partial r}{\partial x} && \frac{\partial r}{\partial y} && \frac{\partial r}{\partial z} \\
        \frac{\partial \theta}{\partial x} && \frac{\partial \theta}{\partial y} && \frac{\partial \theta}{\partial z} \\
        \frac{\partial \phi}{\partial x} && \frac{\partial \phi}{\partial y} && \frac{\partial \phi}{\partial z} \\ \end{pmatrix}
\end{equation}
++++

it then follows that latexmath:[J^{-1}] will give us:

[latexmath]
++++
\begin{equation}
J^{-1} = \begin{pmatrix} \frac{\partial x}{\partial r} && \frac{\partial x}{\partial \theta} && \frac{\partial x}{\partial \phi} \\
        \frac{\partial y}{\partial r} && \frac{\partial y}{\partial \theta} && \frac{\partial y}{\partial \phi} \\
        \frac{\partial z}{\partial r} && \frac{\partial z}{\partial \theta} && \frac{\partial z}{\partial \phi} \\ \end{pmatrix}
\end{equation}
++++

latexmath:[J] will be multipled with a latexmath:[(\delta x, \delta y, \delta z)] to give a latexmath:[(\delta r, \delta \theta, \delta \phi)],
whereas latexmath:[J^{-1}] will be multipled with a latexmath:[(\delta r, \delta \theta, \delta \phi)] to give a latexmath:[(\delta x, \delta y, \delta z)].

== Raising and lowering indices

For this, realize you require a metric tensor first of all. You cannot raise or lower indices without a metric tensor. Lets denote the (covariant) metric by latexmath:[g_{\mu \nu}] and the (contravariant) metric by latexmath:[g^{\mu \nu}].

Properties of metric tensor:

- latexmath:[g_{\mu \nu}] and latexmath:[g^{\mu \nu}] are inverse of each other. This is written mathematically as latexmath:[g_{i k} g^{k j} = \delta^{i}_{j}] where
latexmath:[\delta^{i}_{j} = 1] for latexmath:[i=j] and latexmath:[0] otherwise. In matrix lingo this is nothing but latexmath:[g G = I] where I have used latexmath:[g] and latexmath:[G] for the two matrices representing latexmath:[g_{\mu \nu}] and latexmath:[g^{\mu \nu}].
- metric tensor is a tensor of rank 2 so can be written as a latexmath:[d \times d] matrix where latexmath:[d] is the number of dimensions we are dealing with (latexmath:[d=4] for us in physics - 3 for space, 1 for time)
- metric tensor is symmetric so latexmath:[g_{\mu \nu} = g_{\nu \mu}]

Finally, we come to the algorithm to raise or lower an index on any (mixed) tensor. A mixed tensor is a tensor that has a mixture of contravariant and covariant indices.
For computer programmers, it helps to think of a tensor like an N-D array in computer science. In pseudocode, here is a rank 4 tensor:

----
T = new float[d][d][d][d];
----

However, in addition to being an N-D array, _a tensor (in physics) has to obey very specifc rules when its expressed in a different co-ordinate system_. Only then can it be called a tensor.
i.e., if latexmath:[T] is the tensor written in frame 1 and latexmath:[T'] is the same tensor written in frame 2, the numbers in the two N-D arrays have to be related to each other
by very specific rules which are the rules of contravariant and covariant transformations on respective indices.

Anyway here is the algorithm to lower the latexmath:[i] th index on a tensor latexmath:[T(...,i,...)]:

1. First of all, we can do this operation only if latexmath:[i] is upstairs in the tensor. If its already downstairs then this operation is meaningless.
2. Step 1: Write down the tensor and replace latexmath:[i] with another symbol. I choose the next symbol in the alphabet after the last index of latexmath:[T(...,i,...)].
e.g., if we have latexmath:[T(i,j,k,l)] I will use the symbol latexmath:[m]
3. Step 2: Multiply above by latexmath:[g_{\mu \nu}] and replace latexmath:[\nu] with latexmath:[m] and latexmath:[\mu] with latexmath:[i] so it becomes latexmath:[g_{im}]. 
4. Now, you have a repeated index latexmath:[m] and we must sum over it.
5. The result is the tensor with latexmath:[i] in downstairs position.

Symbolically (making the summation explicit):

[latexmath]
++++
\begin{equation}
T_i = \sum_m g_{im}T^{m};
\end{equation}
++++

where I have hidden the other indices on latexmath:[T] as they remain unchanged and carry over as-is to latexmath:[T] on the LHS.

Since we are not doing matrix multiplication, it doesn't matter if you write latexmath:[g_{im}] to the left or right of latexmath:[T(...,m,...)]. Also since
metric tensor is symmetric, it doesn't matter if you use latexmath:[g_{im}] or latexmath:[g_{mi}].

The algorithm to raise an index is similar except that we use latexmath:[g^{\mu \nu}] in this case. The whole operation is also called as contracting latexmath:[T] with
latexmath:[g_{\mu \nu}] or latexmath:[g^{\mu \nu}] as the case may be.

Also remember that in the usual notation used in literature, primes (e.g., latexmath:[T vs. T']) are used to denote the _same_ quantity but measured in different 
co-ordinate systems (a.k.a. reference frames) whereas raising or lowering indices is an operation you do in the same frame and it changes the quantity. It is no longer the _same_. 
This should be evident from above equation.

I think this post ended up being more on mathematics and less on physics. The two are intertwined.
If you understand the notation and tensor math you are already half-way through understanding relativity or other advanced topics like QFT. If you don't understand this
language, the equations will all look gibberish and you won't be able to make any progress.

Btw, I disagree very strongly with statements like time is an illusion. Different observers will measure time differently (because they use different inertial frames) but time is very much real.
