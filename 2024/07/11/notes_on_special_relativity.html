<p>What is the difference between SR (special relativity) and GR (general relativity)?</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>SR is the theory of relativity in the absence of gravity. This can be stated equivalently as saying that SR is the theory of relativity in flat spacetime.
GR is really the theory of gravity. It is the theory of relativity in curved spacetime.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To understand SR, you can start with the postulate that the speed of light has to be constant for all observers (inertial reference frames).
This can be stated equivalently, as saying that the length of spacetime displacement vector (the vector representing motion of light from one point to another)
is invariant between two inertial reference frames under the <em>Minkowski</em> metric. i.e.:</p>
</div>
<div class="stemblock">
<div class="content">
\[\begin{equation}
ds^2 = (c dt)^2 - (dx)^2 - (dy)^2 - (dz)^2 = (c dt')^2 - (dx')^2 - (dy')^2 - (dz')^2
\end{equation}\]
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The prime symbol ' is used to denote a co-ordinate in frame 2.
The Lorentz transformation can then be derived from this assumption. See <a href="https://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/821317/question-on-special-relativity">[1</a>] for some discussion on this whether its right.
In essence, above constraint translates to following <em>equivalent</em> constraint on the Lorentz transformation matrix \(\Lambda\):</p>
</div>
<div class="stemblock">
<div class="content">
\[\begin{equation}
\eta^T = \Lambda^T \eta^T \Lambda
\end{equation}\]
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>where \(\eta\) is the Minknowski metric (or matix depending on how you want to look at it):</p>
</div>
<div class="stemblock">
<div class="content">
\[\begin{equation}
\eta = \begin{pmatrix} 1 &amp;&amp; 0 &amp;&amp; 0 &amp;&amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp;&amp; -1 &amp;&amp; 0 &amp;&amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp;&amp; 0 &amp;&amp; -1 &amp;&amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp;&amp; 0 &amp;&amp; 0 &amp;&amp; -1 \end{pmatrix}
\end{equation}\]
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Remember 1 and 2 are equivalent. You can start from 1 and derive 2 or go in the reverse direction if you so desire.</p>

<p>As I was reading Weinberg p. 35 I was very confused. He says:</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
for any quantity that undergoes the transformation \( \mathbf{V'} = \mathbf{\Lambda V}\), such a \( \mathbf{V}\) should be called a contravariant 4 vector to distinguish it from a covariant 4 vector defined as a quantity \( \mathbf{U}\) whose transformation rule is \( \mathbf{U'} = \mathbf{\Lambda^{-1} U}\)

<p><em>How can he decide at whim that some vectors he will transform as \( \mathbf{\Lambda V}\) and that others he will transform as \( \mathbf{U'} = \mathbf{\Lambda^{-T}U}\) ?</em></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This bothered me to no end and kept me up for many days until I realized that <em>the Lorentz transformation matrix \( \mathbf{\Lambda}\) tells how co-ordinates transform from one inertial reference frame to another. This is not to be confused with how a quantity such as a 4 vector transforms between the two reference frames.</em> To his credit, the complete text from Weinberg&#8217;s book is:</p>

<p>More generally a contravariant vector is a quantity where the i-th component in the other reference frame is given by:</p>
</div>
<div class="stemblock">
<div class="content">
\[\begin{equation}
\mathbf{V'_i} = \sum_j \frac{\partial x'_i}{\partial x_j} \mathbf{V_j}
\end{equation}\]
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Here \(\frac{\partial x'_i}{\partial x_j}\) is partial derivative of the i-th co-ordinate in frame 2 w.r.t. j-th co-ordinate in frame 1 evaluated at some point.
Remember these co-ordinates are like functions or variables of multivariate calculus. This can be expressed in matrix form using the Jacobian matrix as:</p>
</div>
<div class="stemblock">
<div class="content">
\[\mathbf{V'} = \mathbf{J V}\]
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Recall the Jacobian matrix is the matrix of first-order partial differentials.
When the transformation between the co-ordinates is linear i.e., \(\mathbf{x' = M x}\), then the Jacobian is same as \(\mathbf{M}\).
This is generalization of the fact that when \(y = k x\), \(dy / dx = k\). In our case, \(\mathbf{M = \Lambda}\).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Note very very carefully that when you are dealing with multi-variate calculus:</p>

<h2 id="raising-and-lowering-indices">Raising and lowering indices</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For this, realize you require a metric tensor first of all. You cannot raise or lower indices without a metric tensor. Lets denote the (covariant) metric by \(g_{\mu \nu}\) and the (contravariant) metric by \(g^{\mu \nu}\).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Properties of metric tensor:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>\(g_{\mu \nu}\) and \(g^{\mu \nu}\) are inverse of each other. This is written mathematically as \(g_{i k} g^{k j} = \delta^{i}_{j}\) where
\(\delta^{i}_{j} = 1\) for \(i=j\) and \(0\) otherwise. In matrix lingo this is nothing but \(g G = I\) where I have used \(g\) and \(G\) for the two matrices representing \(g_{\mu \nu}\) and \(g^{\mu \nu}\).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>metric tensor is a tensor of rank 2 so can be written as a \(d \times d\) matrix where \(d\) is the number of dimensions we are dealing with (\(d=4\) for us in physics - 3 for space, 1 for time)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>metric tensor is symmetric so \(g_{\mu \nu} = g_{\nu \mu}\)</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Finally, we come to the algorithm to raise or lower an index on any (mixed) tensor. A mixed tensor is a tensor that has a mixture of contravariant and covariant indices.
For computer programmers, it helps to think of a tensor like an N-D array in computer science. In pseudocode, here is a rank 4 tensor:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>T = new float[d][d][d][d];</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>However, in addition to being an N-D array, <em>a tensor (in physics) has to obey very specifc rules when its expressed in a different co-ordinate system</em>. Only then can it be called a tensor.
i.e., if \(T\) is the tensor written in frame 1 and \(T'\) is the same tensor written in frame 2, the numbers in the two N-D arrays have to be related to each other
by very specific rules which are the rules of contravariant and covariant transformations on respective indices.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Anyway here is the algorithm to lower the \(i\) th index on a tensor \(T(...,i,...)\):</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>First of all, we can do this operation only if \(i\) is upstairs in the tensor. If its already downstairs then this operation is meaningless.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Step 1: Write down the tensor and replace \(i\) with another symbol. I choose the next symbol in the alphabet after the last index of \(T(...,i,...)\).
e.g., if we have \(T(i,j,k,l)\) I will use the symbol \(m\)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Step 2: Multiply above by \(g_{\mu \nu}\) and replace \(\nu\) with \(m\) and \(\mu\) with \(i\) so it becomes \(g_{im}\).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Now, you have a repeated index \(m\) and we must sum over it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The result is the tensor with \(i\) in downstairs position.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Symbolically:</p>
</div>
<div class="stemblock">
<div class="content">
\[\begin{equation}
T_i = \sum_m g_{im}T^{m};
\end{equation}\]
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>where I have hidden the other indices on \(T\) as they remain unchanged and carry over as-is to \(T\).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Since we are not doing matrix multiplication, it doesn&#8217;t matter if you write \(g_{im}\) to the left or right of \(T(...,m,...)\). Also since
metric tensor is symmetric, it doesn&#8217;t matter if you use \(g_{im}\) or \(g_{mi}\).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The algorithm to raise an index is similar except that we use \(g^{\mu \nu}\) in this case. The whole operation is also called as contracting \(T\) with
\(g_{\mu \nu}\) or \(g^{\mu \nu}\) as the case may be.</p>
