<ul>
<li>
<p>describe what features you are going to build e.g., we will build a chat application that will allow users to exchange messages. will it support chat rooms where more than 2 people can join? how many (maximum)?
how many chat rooms will a user be able to join? how many friends can user have in their friend list? can user be anywhere on the globe?</p>

<p>specify how to measure success using metrics — bonus points if you can link to a dashboard that tracks those metrics (e.g., we will support a QPS of 30 queries per second)</p>
</li>

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Non-Goals are equally important to describe which problems you won’t be fixing so everyone is on the same page. e.g., our chat application will not support multimedia content. or our chat application will not support
notifications.</p>

<p>The main section of the design doc. How will the problem be solved? In most cases, a system can be broken down into UI (the frontend) - is it web or mobile? Android or IOS? and the backend. Will backend run on a cloud
platform? Which one? Lay out your assumptions. How will user authentication and authorization work? What database will be used? Will you use a RDBMS (if yes, which one?) or NoSQL (if yes, which one?) and why?
How will you protect against single point of failure? How will data be backed up? What will network topology look like? Where will each component run? Think about security and performance. Each of the topics mentioned
could be, and often is, a design doc in itself. E.g., there is usually separate design doc of frontend and backend. List all the APIs you will develop e.g., if you are developing a record management app for a library
list out all the endpoints and what will the request/response look like:</p>

put in place to measure performance of the system? What alarms will you put in place so engineers are alerted before system completely breaks down? (e.g., fire alarm when disk quota reaches 99% used space, requests per
second reach X, latency - the time to serve a request - reaches Y etc.). List all the tools you will use here for testing, monitoring, alerting etc.</p>
